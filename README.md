# Very very simple backup WordPress plugin
I am making this plugin for my needs, for a small site that don't need fancy plugins for backup job. This plugin zip whole WordPress and add database dump into zip. 
I'll be using this plugin to manually backup some of my sites that do not have many changes. If You find this code usable feel free to download :) 
It should work on most servers, but I'v tested this plugin only for my needs and settings. 

# Installation
Just install as any other plugin. Visit "Very Simple Backup" admin menu page and click "Backup now" button. Download created files. That's it!!! 
Please don't forget to delete backed up files when You download them.

## Issues to fix

* Remove latin letters and dots from generated .zip filename
